# Contribute to `gatsby-package-manager`

Howdy! Nice to meet you. If you're thinking about contributing and improving `gatsby-package-manager` you're pretty awesome.

I welcome any contributions both code and no-code.

Here's a basic example of getting started by setting up a local environment.

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone your fork to your local PC ` git clone https://github.com/username/gatsby-package-manager` <small>‚ö†Ô∏è Remember to change the URL</small>
3. `npm install` in the root directory
4. `npm start` to run the CLI
5. `npm link` in the root directory to test your changes
6. `npm link` will give you an exact path to where `gpm` gets installed, [in my case (gif)](https://on.ahmda.ws/650e60/c), it's `/Users/ahmadawais/.asdf/installs/nodejs/12.13.0/.npm/bin/gpm` now if I run this in any other directory, it will be the same `gpm` only modified. Every time you change something, run `npm link` again.


Peace! ‚úåÔ∏è
